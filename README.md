A modern onchain analytics tool that generates **beautiful, downloadable identity cards** for any wallet on **Base**.  
Built by **ZiZ 🧿** using React, TailwindCSS, and the BaseScan API.

</p>

A focused web app for generating a clean onchain identity card from any Base wallet address.  
Enter an address → fetch onchain activity → generate a compact identity card → export it as a PNG.  
The app even supports **zero-activity wallets**, generating a minimal card instead of errors.

## 🔒 Usage Notes & Privacy

-PNG export happens fully locally in the browser.

-The app sends no data to any backend.

-Only BaseScan API calls are made to fetch public onchain data.

-Zero-activity wallets still generate a clean minimal card.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

-PNG export may exclude token/NFT images if external hosts block CORS.

-Token/NFT counts are based on transfer logs, not exact contract calls.

-High-rate API requests may produce temporary “NOTOK” responses.

-Badges and Builder Score are designed for visualization, not exact ranking.
